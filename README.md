I found that there were no helpful tutorials that simply demonstrated how to use this popular component. In order to demonstrate to (frustrated) developers how to utilise the react-infinite-scroll-component, I created a simple web page.

This page includes JSONPlaceholder fetch calls, rendering logic and pagination logic - everything you will need to get up and running with this component.

Link to the react component on NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component).
